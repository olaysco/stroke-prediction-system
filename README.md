# AI Systems and Human Factors

This repository contains my research work on exploring stroke-risk prediction using 4 machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC (RBF) and XGBoost) evaluated on diverse datasets. The goal is to compare model performance while evaluating the models on interpretability and human factors considerations.

## Repository Layout
- `stroke_analysis.ipynb` – end-to-end notebook that loads the datasets, prepares the features, trains four classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, RBF-kernel SVC, XGBoost), and compares performance.
- `results.csv` – persisted evaluation metrics (per-model accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, plus cross-validation stats) generated by the notebook.
- `datasets/` – four CSV files (`dataset1`–`dataset4`) referenced by the notebook. Paths are configured in the `DATASETS` dictionary near the top of the notebook.

## Environment Setup
1. Use Python 3.10+.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost ipykernel notebook
   ```
